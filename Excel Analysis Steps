### Project working with student names, birth dates and scores utilizing Microsoft Excel. 
Data Source: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zqEy1RgVx1QUh8qkYX0mwiIR8_WpuAO8L4f4g4twmrg/edit#gid=0

The following are the steps I took to prepare the data for analysis with Excel functions/formulas:

1. Duplicate raw data into new sheet: Home, Format, Move or Copy Sheet
2. Find and remove any duplicate data: Data, Remove Duplicates
3. Check for missing data: Home, Find & Select, Go To Special, select Blanks
4. Split Name into first & last name: Data, Text to Columns
5. Extract year from date of birth (DOB): =YEAR(B2)
6. Extract day of the week from DOB: =TEXT(B2,"dddd")
7. Find age using 1/1/2022 for calculations: =DATEDIF(B2,("1/1/2022"),"y")
8. Convert score into a letter grade: =IFS(C2>=91,"A",C2>=81,"B",C2>=71,"C",C2>=61,"D",C2<=60,"F")
9. Assign pass or fail with C or above average: 
=IF(I2="A","PASS",IF(I2="B","PASS",IF(I2="C","PASS","FAIL")))
10. Create 7 sections and randomly assign students: 
=CHOOSE(RANDBETWEEN(1,7),"Section-1","Section-2","Section-3",
"Section-4", "Section-5", "Section-6", "Section-7")
11. Create a unique ID first 2 intitials of first name, last name, last 2 digits of birth year 
and 3 digit random number: Multi part solution == 
First 2 initials =LEFT(A2,2); last name =RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-SEARCH(" ",A2)));
last 2 digits of birth year =RIGHT(YEAR(B2),2); random 3 digit id =RANDBETWEEN(100,900); 
combining all new parts=L2&M2&N2&O2
12. Create email addresses with the unique identifier: =CONCAT(P2,"@DataWorkout.com")
13. Find hypenated names, return True or False: =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("-",A2)),"TRUE","FALSE")
14. Find whether a students first name is longer than nme, retunr T/F:
=IF(LEN(D2)>LEN(E2), "TRUE", "FALSE")
15. Match first name letter with Nato-phonetic-alphabet (in another sheet) and display
corresponding phonetic code word: =VLOOKUP(T2,'Nato-phonetic-alphabet'!$A$2:$B$27, 2, FALSE)
16. Duplicated sheet with values only to protect the formulas for statistical evaluation: 
Select entire sheet, Copy, + new sheet, Edit, Paste special, select Values
17. Statistical analysis: Average =ROUND(AVERAGE(C2:C200),1); Median =MEDIAN(C2:C200); Mode =MODE(c2:C200);
Standard deviation =STDEV(C2:C200); Max =MAX(C2:C200); Min =MIN(C2:C200); Range =MAX(C2:C200)-MIN(C2:C200)

Data was used to create Pivot Tables, Pivot Graphs and a Dashboard.
